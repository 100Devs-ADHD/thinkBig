### **Branch naming & pull requests**

This repo is set up to not allow any commits to be pushed directly to the `main` or `dev` branches.

Create a new branch using the format `YourUserName/very-short-description`.
When you're ready to submit a pull request, you will want to merge it in to `dev`. Ideally, this pull request will correspond with one or more [Issues](https://github.com/100Devs-ADHD/thinkBig/issues).

We will submit pull requests from `dev` to `main` when we have enough meaningful changes committed.

## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature? You can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/100Devs-ADHD/think-big/issues). Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**
