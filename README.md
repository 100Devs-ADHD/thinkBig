## About

ThinkBig is an educational web application that facilitates peer collaboration and organization for long-distance learning. This application is being designed for an agency's training program.

<br/>

## Built With

* [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
* [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)

<br/>

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

This repository requires the use of [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli). You can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### **Installation**

To install the required packages & dependencies:

### `npm i`

### **Usage**

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

<br/>

### **Commiting Code**

When leaving commits, please give a detailed description of what changes were made and where.

### `git commit -m "Author: ..." -m "Date: ..." -m "Description: ..."`

<br/>

### **Branch naming & pull requests**

This repo is set up to not allow any commits to be pushed directly to the `main` or `dev` branches.

Create a new branch using the format `YourUserName/very-short-description`.
When you're ready to submit a pull request, you will want to merge it in to `dev`. Ideally, this pull request will correspond with one or more [Issues](https://github.com/100Devs-ADHD/thinkBig/issues).

We will submit pull requests from `dev` to `main` when we have enough meaningful changes committed.

<br/>
